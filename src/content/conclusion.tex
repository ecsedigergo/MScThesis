\chapter{Conclusion and future work}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In conclusion in my first semester of thesis work, I have examined the Demonstrator railway system with all of its components. I have created architectural overview with basic functional and component details in order to give an overall picture. I have searched and inquired into test strategies for this multi layered application. I have created test scenarios in different test levels and decided which component have serious affect in safety critical point of view.

Further ideas are implementing and evaluating the test scenarios with different techniques if needed. Finally I will collect the experiences and summarize the result of test approaches.
